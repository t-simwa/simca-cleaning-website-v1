---

## Typical Pricing Structures

### Contract Cleaning (Monthly)
Most commercial cleaning is billed monthly with the following considerations:

### 2. Compare Quality, Not Just Price
The cheapest option may cost more in the long run due to:

# Pest Control in Mombasa: Dealing with Coastal Climate Challenges

Mombasa's warm, humid coastal climate creates perfect conditions for pests. From termites threatening building structures to cockroaches affecting food safety, understanding pest behavior and prevention is essential for homes and businesses.

## Quick Answer

Mombasa's coastal climate (warm, humid year-round) requires **year-round pest management** rather than seasonal treatment. Common pests include termites, cockroaches, mosquitoes, rodents, and ants. Professional fumigation every 1-3 months is recommended for commercial properties, with residential treatments as needed.

---

## Why Coastal Kenya Has Unique Pest Challenges

### Climate Factors
- **High humidity** (60-80%) — Pests thrive in moist environments
- **Warm temperatures** (24-30°C year-round) — No winter to kill pest populations
- **Rainy seasons** — Drive pests indoors seeking shelter
- **Proximity to water** — Mosquito breeding, marine pest intrusion

### Common Pests in Mombasa

| Pest | Risk Level | Primary Concern |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Termites | High | Structural damage to buildings |
| Cockroaches | High | Food contamination, disease spread |
| Mosquitoes | High | Malaria, dengue, chikungunya |
| Rodents | Medium-High | Property damage, disease, food contamination |
| Ants | Medium | Food contamination, some species bite |
| Bed bugs | Medium | Hotels, residential, health facilities |

---

## Pest-Specific Solutions

### Termites
Mombasa's warm climate makes termite infestations particularly aggressive.

**Warning Signs:**
- Mud tubes on walls or foundations
- Hollow-sounding wood
- Discarded wings near windows
- Visible damage to wooden structures

**Treatment Options:**
- Pre-construction soil treatment (for new buildings)
- Post-construction barrier treatment
- Bait systems for ongoing control
- Spot treatments for localized infestations

**Prevention:**
- Regular inspections (annually minimum)
- Reduce wood-to-soil contact
- Fix water leaks promptly
- Proper ventilation to reduce moisture

### Cockroaches
Coastal humidity provides ideal cockroach breeding conditions.

**Common Species:**
- German cockroach (kitchens, food areas)
- American cockroach (drains, basements)
- Oriental cockroach (damp areas)

**Control Methods:**
- Gel baits in infested areas
- Residual sprays along entry points
- Improved sanitation and food storage
- Sealing entry points

### Mosquitoes
A serious health concern in coastal Kenya.

**Breeding Sites:**
- Stagnant water
- Blocked gutters
- Water storage containers
- Air conditioning drip trays

**Prevention:**
- Eliminate standing water
- Use larvicides in water features
- Install screens on windows
- Regular fogging in high-risk areas

### Rodents
Rats and mice damage property and spread disease.

**Control Strategies:**
- Baiting programs
- Trapping
- Entry point sealing
- Habitat modification

---

## Commercial vs. Residential Pest Control

- Food safety in restaurants and kitchens
