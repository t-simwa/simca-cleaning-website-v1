Hi! I wanted to update you on the website progress.

The website is now completed with just a few minor changes left to make. I've added the company pictures I received from Breen, registered a domain for the website, and the site is now accessible via Google. The booking service is also functional and ready to use. I'm attaching the site link here for your review.

Before I finalize everything, I need a few things from you:

1. Exact Google Maps pins for your business locations, preferably Mombasa first
2. A picture of yourself for the CEO section
3. Your company's actual mission and values

Once I have these, I can complete the remaining updates. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback on the site.

Thanks!
